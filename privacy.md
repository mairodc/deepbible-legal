# Privacy
"I", "me", "my", etc. throughout this policy refers to the developer.

Deepbible stores the following data about individual users:
    
    Usernames and display names;
    Server names;
    The actions each user runs for the bot, along with some metadata (such as what action, which server, etc);
    Any feedback they send through /feedback


This data is collected via command usage.

I use this data to:

    Make the bot function
    Fix bugs 
    Prevent spam 
    Ensure that the bot is functioning properly

In order to delete all of the data the bot has stored about a user, simply contact the developer on Discord. (.mairo.)

Deepbible also collects and stores aggregated data (for example, how many servers it's in, how many users are in those servers, etc.). The aggregated, anonymized data I collect can be stored and shared for any reason, including:

    Improving the bot;
    Updating the bot's server count in it's status.

This policy may be updated at any time.
